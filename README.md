Description of the Course
-------------------------
Introduction to the discipline of statistics, with a focus on querying, exploring, understanding and transforming data features for statistical and machine learning applications.

### Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of [Python 3](https://github.com/zipfian/gU-precourse/tree/master/lesson_2_programming), [probability](https://github.com/zipfian/gU-precourse/tree/master/lesson_4_probability) and [statistics](https://github.com/zipfian/gU-precourse/tree/master/lesson_5_statistics) is expected prior to taking this course.

### By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Write Basic SQL Queries
* Demonstrate Python Programming Skills for Statistical Data Analysis
* Collect Good Data According to the Purpose of the Analysis
* Explore Data with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
* Calculate Probabilities
* Identify and Manipulate Random Variables / Distributions
* Make Statistical Inference from Sample to Population
* Model Quantitative Response Variable with Linear Regression
* Model Binary Response Variable with Logistic Regression
* Model Time Series Data

These learning objectives correspond with standards in the Galvanize [Mastery Tracker](https://learn.galvanize.com/cohorts/79) and will be the basis for your evaluation in this course.

### Supplementary Materials:

### Mastery Tracking:

At Galvanize,  Mastery Tracking is utilized to evaluate real-time student performance across standards and issue final grades at the end the course.

Standards are the core-competencies of Galvanize graduates - the knowledge, skills, and habits every student should possess by time they graduate. Standards are measurable, student-focused outcomes that state what students are expected to be able to do by the end of the course. Instructors continually provide formative assessments to monitor student performance and inform their teaching practices. Students who are below ‘mastery’ on a standard are expected to continue practicing said standard (with the instructor’s guidance) until they reach mastery. What matters is that students eventually learn the material, not how many attempts it takes to get there.

Mastery Tracking uses a 4-point scale. Every student is expected to achieve 3 (mastery) across all standards by time they complete the course. 1s and 2s indicate areas where students need further practice and/or interventions to reach mastery. Unlike grades for individual assignments, mastery tracking can always be adjusted according to performance up to and including the final exam.

**4 pt Scale:**  
1. Falling far below mastery - Meeting none of the success criteria or has egregious errors  
2. Approaching mastery - Meeting some of the success criteria  
3. Mastery - Meeting all of the success criteria  
4. Exceeding mastery - Truly exceeding expectations and demonstrating proficiency at a higher level of rigor  

Course Requirements
-------------------------------

### Class Attendance:
Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify your instructor by Slack in advance. Supporting documents (doctor’s notes) should accompany absences due to sickness. Each excused absences beyond 2 or any unexcused absences will result in lowering your __overall course grade by ⅓ of an entire letter grade__ (A->A-, A->B+). It is at the instructor’s discretion to deny any absences or to allow students to make-up assignments, exams, etc. resulted from any absences.

### Participation
You must also show up prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random not to put you on the spot but to keep you engaged in the material at all times. All preparation materials (book readings, videos and websites) should be covered prior to each class session. They are __always required__ unless explicitly labeled as optional.  

### Electronic Devices
Cell phones can be highly disruptive to the class environment. Please silence these devices. In the event of an emergency, please step out of the classroom.  

Laptops, while necessary for labs, can be a distraction during the lecture portion of the lesson. At the discression of individual instructors, laptops may be allowed for portions of the class but unless instructed otherwise, *laptops must remained closed during the quiz and lecture portions of the class unless otherwise indicated*.

### RAT
The Readiness Assessment Tool (RAT) is intended to ensure that students comprehended the material consumed between classes. Students unsure of their comprehension should bring questions to be addressed before the individual RAT. After each student has answered all the questions on the RAT individually, the class will split into teams, who will then review their answers and attempt to reach consensus. Misunderstandings are often better addressed by peers. It is important that all members of each team understand the solution provided by their team. Finally, the answers to the questions will be gone over by the class, hopefully resolving any final misunderstandings before proceeding with the projects.

### Lab Exercises
Participation in and completion of lab exercises is a requirement for this course. Each unit includes exercises to provide practice applying techniques discussed in class and to reveal deficiencies in understanding in preparation for skills tests. These exercises may be done in pairs or small groups. _Collaboration must be indicated_ when turning in your assignment. Unless otherwise stated, answers to the lab exercises are due before the following class (_e.g._ Labs assigned on Tuesday are due at 1pm on Thursday. Labs assigned on Friday or due at 1pm the following Monday.)

### Midterm Project
There will be one midterm project that will assess your comprehension of the preliminary material of the course including data manipulation, generation, probability, and basic statistics. This project will be assigned on Monday, September 26, and will be due the following Monday, October 3, before class, at 1pm. Unlike the lab exercises, the final project **must be completed individually**.

### Final Project
There will be one final summative project that will assess your comprehension of the material throughout the term. This will be assigned during the seventh week of class and will be due at the end of finals week, at 1pm on October 21. Unlike the lab exercises, the final project **must be completed individually**. Collusion, plagiarism, and cheating will not be tolerated.

Here is a tentative rubric for the final project. The four columns refer to the same four levels of mastery described above. Keep this rubric in mind as we go through the course and make sure that you can do these things so that there will be no surprises when you receive the assignment.

### Academic Integrity
GalvanizeU is an academic community based on the principles of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integrity is a core University value which ensures respect for the academic reputation of the University, its students, faculty and staff, and the degrees it confers.

The University expects that all students will learn in an environment where they work independently in the pursuit of knowledge, conduct themselves in an honest and ethical manner and respect the intellectual work of others. Each member of the University community has a responsibility to be familiar with the definitions contained in, and adhere to, the Academic Integrity Policy. Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy include, but are not limited to:

- Cheating -- i.e. Don't read off of your neighbors exams
- Collusion -- Group work is encouraged except on evaluative exams. When working together (on exercises, etc.), acknowledgment of collaboration is required.
- Plagiarism -- Reusing code presented in labs and lectures is expected, but copying someone else's solution to a problem is a form of plagiarism (even if you change the formatting or variable names).
- Facilitating academic dishonesty

Students who are dishonest in any class assignment or exam will receive an "F" in this course. More information regarding UNH’s official academic integrity policies are outlined in [here](http://www.newhaven.edu/334887.pdf). If you are ever in doubt, ask the instructor for clarification.
