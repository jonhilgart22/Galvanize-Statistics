    "Squirt Squad is a cleaning service that sends crews to residential homes on either a once-a-month or twice-a-month schedule, depending on the customer’s preference. The owner would like to predict the amount of time required to clean a house based on the square footage of the house, the total number of rooms in the house, the number of bathrooms it has, the size of the cleaning crew, the frequency of the cleaning schedule, and whether or not the household has children. Data can be found in the tables **`squad`** (containing `squad_id`, `home_id`, `crew` and `freq` (0: once-a-month, 1: twice-a-month); **`squad_homes`** (containing `home_id`, `footage`, `rooms`, `baths` and `children` (Squirt Squad assumes the number of children in a house will never change. BONUS: how would you change the schema to account for the possibility that it will?)); and **`squad_times`** (containing `squad_id` and `dt`, `time` and `crew` (redundant with `squad` but included in case the squad size changes)). You will need to construct a three-way join using `home_id` and `squad_id`.\n",
