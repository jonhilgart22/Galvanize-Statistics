# Midterm Part 2 - _Due Monday, October 3_
---
## Note: this is part of the midterm. It is _not_ a paired programming assignment. **You must complete this _on your own_**.
---

Part 2 of the Midterm is also part 1 of the Final. In it you must fulfill the same first three criteria described in your [final project proposal](https://github.com/zipfian/DSCI6001-student/blob/master/week3/3.4/Final_Project_Proposal.ipynb) for 6001, _i.e._  
1. Where you are going to get your data from - yes, it can be standard sets.
2. What you are going to do with your data.
3. Why is the project interesting.

The Midterm will be assessed according to the first six items in the rubric described in [the syllabus](https://github.com/zipfian/DSCI6002-student/blob/master/README.md#final-project), namely:  
1. Collect Good Data According to the Purpose of the Analysis
2. Write Basic SQL
3. Demonstrate Python Programming Skills for Statistical Data Analysis
4. Demonstrate Exploratory Data Analysis techniques
5. Calculate Probabilities
6. Identify and Manipulate Random Variables / Distributions

The first five of these appeared in [the first part of your midterm](https://github.com/zipfian/DSCI6002-student/blob/master/week3/3-1_Review/DSCI6002-Midterm-Part1.ipynb) and you may use that as a guide.
