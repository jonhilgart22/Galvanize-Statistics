    "6) Brandon Lang is a creative entrepreneur who has developed a novelty soap item called Jackpot to target consumers with a gambling habit. Inside each bar of Jackpot shower soap is a single rolled-up bill of U.S. currency. The currency (rolled up and sealed in shrink-wrap) is appropriately inserted into the soap mixture prior to the cutting and stamping procedure. The distribution of paper currency (per 1000 bars of soap) is given in the following table.  \n",

What are the mean and variance of $X$? (**Note**: You are not required to complete this problem, so don't spend too much time on this. This is just to get you to start thinking about the probabilities of events when we have multiple trials of an experiment - we will talk about this on Monday.)"
