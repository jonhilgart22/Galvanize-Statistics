    "The file `outage.csv` contains the number of power outages Kampala (Ugandan city) experiences each month for the past 72 months\n",

    "1. Read in the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6002/data/outage.csv` using pandas\n",
    "2. Plot the data on a histogram \n",
    "  - Set `normed=True` to get the probability density histogram\n",
    "  - Set `bins=20` to get smaller bins for the histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  What distribution would you consider fitting the data to given the nature of the data ?\n",
    "  - Think about if the data is discrete or continuous \n",
    "  - Think about what the data describes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write down the equation that would model the random variable in question with the distribution you have chosen\n",
    "\n",

    "   - $\\text{Let X be the number of heads in 5 coin flips}$\n",
    "   - $X \\sim Binomial(n, p)$\n",

    "   **Hint**:\n",
    "   - A **parameter** of the binomial distribution will be `n` or `p` for example\n",
    "   - This will be based on the distribution you have chosen above\n",
    "   - The likelihood function would be the product of the probabilities for each data point \n",

    "6. Write a python function that will calculate the likelihood of a parameter given the data\n",
    "   - The function will take a parameter and the data\n",
    "   - Use `scipy.stats` and `numpy.product()`\n",

    "   \n",
